This code re-invents the wheel that so many others have invented. There are a
ton of Arduino and C libraries which talk to these inexpensive boards. I wrote
this because I learn about IoT parts by reading the datasheet and writing my
own code. I intend to pair this with an Arduino for a low-power project, so I
will provide updates on how to configure it for minimum power usage.
